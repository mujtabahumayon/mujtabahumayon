👋 **Hello! I'm Mujtaba Humayon**
> Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Problem Solver

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights and building machine learning models to solve real-world problems. Here, you'll find projects that showcase my skills in data science, from customer segmentation models to deep learning applications in cybersecurity.

🌟 **About Me**

I’m currently working on my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, focusing on machine learning, data mining, and cloud computing. My journey began with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Iqra University, where I dived into software development and data structures, eventually finding my passion in data science.

When I’m not coding, I’m likely exploring the latest tech trends or working on collaborative projects to keep pushing my skills forward.
