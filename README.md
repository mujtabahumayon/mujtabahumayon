👋 **Hello! I'm Mujtaba Humayon**
> Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Problem Solver

## Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀  

I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights and building machine learning models to solve real-world problems. My work spans customer segmentation, fraud detection, and deep learning applications in cybersecurity.

### 🌟 About Me  

I recently earned my **Master’s in Computer Science** from the **University of Alabama at Birmingham**, where I focused on **machine learning, data mining, and cloud computing**. My journey began with a **Bachelor’s in Computer Science** from **Iqra University**, where I built a strong foundation in **software development, data structures, and AI-driven applications**.  

Currently, I work as a **Data Analyst at StarTech Networks Inc.**, where I analyze complex datasets, develop interactive dashboards, and apply machine learning to optimize business strategies.  

When I’m not coding, I’m likely exploring the latest tech trends, working on open-source projects, or deep-diving into AI and cybersecurity research.
